# Cocktail_Selector
## A website to help educate the user on cocktail selection.
* The Cocktail Selector is a website that provides detailed information on a list of different cocktails enabling the user to make an informed decision when choosing a cocktail. 
* To start, you can take one of two actions.
* Action one: Enter the name of your favorite cocktail in the search box.
* After taking Action one, you will be shown your favorite cocktail. Then you may select the "Details" button.
* Action two: Scroll down the page and select the "Details" button on any of the cocktails that are already displayed.
* Details Page - When a user clicks on the "Details" button on an individual cocktail, they are taken to that specific individual cocktail page.
* On the individual cocktail page, they receive more information about that specific cocktail including: the cocktail image, name, category, info (alcoholic or not), instructions on how to prepare the cocktail, and a list of ingredients.
* At the top of the "Details Page" there is a clickable button labeled "Back Home" which when clicked by the user will take the user back to the "Home" page to enable them to start over and create another search from the search form text input.
* About Page - The About Page is on a clickable Navigation link in the header. When a user clicks the "About" link in the navigation bar, they are taken to the "About Us" page which has a short paragraph welcoming the visitor to the website and explaining how to use the site.
